## Welcome Page

Hello and welcome to Haochen's website!

![](Best-Website-Welcome-Message-Examples.png)

This is a website to introduce myself -- currently I'm a freshman of CUIMC, majoring in biostatistics.

This is my [resume](Haochen Sun_CV.pdf). (This is a short, one-paged version) For more details, please visit [this site](about.html).

Here is a link to my [github](https://github.com/SamuelSun2000) and some links of my repositories.

+ [A branch of my RA work](https://github.com/SamuelSun2000/xqtl-pipeline)

+ [A homework](https://github.com/SamuelSun2000/p8105_hw3_hs3393) just to make this website more fancy.

Sorry I have programs that is now private so you cannot visit on github :(

To connect me, please <a href = "mailto: hs3393@cmuc.columbia.edu"> Email me !</a>

To visit the dashboard I made, please visit [this site](plot-result.html).
