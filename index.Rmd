## Welcome Page

Hello and welcome to Haochen's website.

This is a website to introduce myself -- currently I'm a student of CUIMC, majoring in biostatistics.

This is my [resume](Haochen Sun_CV.pdf). (This is a short, one-paged version)

Here is a link to my [github]() and some links of my repositories.
+ [a branch of my RA work]()
+ [a homework just to make this website more fancy]()

Sorry I have programs that is now private so you cannot visit on github :(
